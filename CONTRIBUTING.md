## Dev Setup

- Node 18 or newer is recommended.
- Clone the repository and install dependencies via `npm install`.
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values.
- Run `npm run dev` to start the server in development mode.

## Code Style

- Keep changes small and focused.
- Write descriptive commit messages prefaced with `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.
- Add comments for nonâ€‘obvious logic and avoid large functionsâ€”prefer small, pure functions.

## Testing

- Use `testMode` when sending emails during development. This will restrict sending to the first five recipients and is enabled by default in the UI.
- Provide sample CSV and XLSX files in the `/samples` directory to help with testing.
